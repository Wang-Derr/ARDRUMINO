# ARD*SEQU*INO (WIP)

Open source Arduino based sequencer and sample player.

A lot of To-Dos to follow up on at the moment.

## Version Log

### V0.1

First release containing all basic functionality I had planned for this device. Works, but needs work.
- functioning 384 step sequencer
- Potentiometer work to control track volume, global volume, global attack, and global release
- kit select for the WAV trigger
- MIDI channel controls
- Keys can play midi notes (but issues with simultaneous playing, being investigated)

*If you have any questions feel free to submit an issue.*
